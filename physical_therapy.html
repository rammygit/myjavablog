            	Our Physical Therapists work in conjunction with our Neurologist and Orthopedic Surgeon to design patient rehabilitation from injury or illness.
            </p>

				Using a combination of Manual Therapy and Education, a Physical Therapist can assist you in returning you back to safely perform your daily tasks after an injury, heal soft tissues with a combination of massage, manipulation and mobilization of bones, joints and tissues.

            <h4>Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE)</h4>
            <p>
            Our Physical Therapist uses a variety of tools, techniques and instruments to measure the physical abilities of a patient before and after an injury (i.e., work injury). FCEs are used:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>to improve the likelihood that the patient will be safe in subsequent job performance</li>
                <li><p>determine the presence and if so, the degree of disability so that a bureaucratic or juridical entity can assign, apportion, or deny financial and medical disability benefits.</p></li>
              </ul>
